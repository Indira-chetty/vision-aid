Vision Aid is an advanced assistive technology designed to empower visually impaired individuals by integrating cutting-edge artificial intelligence. It leverages PaddleOCR for text recognition, YOLOv5 for deep learning-based object detection, and Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) for real-time audio conversion. Vision Aid bridges accessibility gaps by enabling users to read printed text, recognize objects, and navigate their surroundings independently.
Traditional accessibility tools often lack real-time efficiency and high accuracy, leaving visually impaired individuals reliant on external assistance. Vision Aid addresses these challenges with a structured methodology: image acquisition, preprocessing, text recognition, object detection, and conversion of extracted information into audible feedback. Deep learning algorithms enhance accuracy, ensuring reliable performance across various environments. The user-friendly interface is designed to accommodate different levels of visual impairment.
Model optimization is key to Vision Aidâ€™s performance. PaddleOCR is fine-tuned using adaptive thresholding and Gaussian blurring, while YOLOv5 undergoes enhancements to improve precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP). Real-world testing has demonstrated high success rates in both text recognition and object identification, making the system highly reliable for daily use.
Future mobile and cloud-based enhancements will further improve accessibility, allowing deployment across various devices. By leveraging AI to promote independence and inclusivity, Vision Aid sets a new standard for assistive technologies.
